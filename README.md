# logo_detection.

We implemented Logo_detector model using CNN.

# The Training Model Will Be Found In Training_Model.ipynb.

It was used to train both football_club brands detector and car brands detector.<br>
300 dataset images was used in football_clubs.<br>
20,778 dataset images was used in cars.<br>
Another architectures was tried as: alexnet.ipynb,cifar10.ipynb,vggnet.ipynb.<br>
But the final architectures used in training and prediction will be found in Training_Model.ipynb
as it achieved the highest accuracy

# The Trained Weights of The Model:

To run the code make sure that 'car.h5py' and 'football.h5py' are located in the same folder of the project.<br>
